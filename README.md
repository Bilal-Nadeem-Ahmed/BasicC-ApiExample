# Basic C# Api

This is a small example project using C#, SQLLight and entity framework. It also has a generic exception handler and the logic is seperated in to different projects for the services, the repos and the controllers. 

This was originally a technichnical test for a job but I thought id upload it here, The requirements where pretty specific hence the limited functionality. Feel free to clone, fork and do as you please with it!
